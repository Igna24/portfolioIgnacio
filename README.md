# README

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

This repository hosts the creation of my personal portfolio. I want to emphasize that while it's a work in progress, it's not yet 100% completed. I'm actively working on developing and enhancing my portfolio, as well as implementing additional technologies such as Sass and JavaScript to improve the user experience and add additional functionalities.

The purpose of this portfolio is to effectively showcase my work, skills, and achievements in the field of programming and web development. As I continue working on its development, I will be adding more featured projects and expanding the existing sections to provide a comprehensive overview of my experience and knowledge.

I appreciate your understanding and patience as I work towards completing this project. Stay tuned for updates and improvements that I will be implementing! If you have any suggestions or comments, please feel free to share them with me.

Thank you for visiting my repository and for your interest in my work. I hope that my constantly evolving portfolio reflects my dedication and passion for programming and web development.

Best regards, <br>
Ignacio Marin Garro
